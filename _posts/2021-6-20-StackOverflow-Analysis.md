title: Can You Still Get Hired As A Developer When You Have No CS Background?
---

## Motivation

This question always bothers me when contemplating the career-shift I'm attempting to do.

And that's why I started with this question in the first project of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

I chose to analyze the StackOverflow data from 2015 until 2020 to answer the question in the title and another 2 questions that also bother me, and they are:
* How present are professional developers with no CS background in the market?
* What non-degree education should a data scientist focus on?
* Is job satisfaction related to salary? or are there other factors?
