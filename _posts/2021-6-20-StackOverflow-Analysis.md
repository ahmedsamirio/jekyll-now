title: Can You Still Get Hired As A Developer When You Have No CS Background?
---

## Motivation

This question always bothers me when contemplating the career-shift I'm attempting to do.

And that's why I started with this question in the first project of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

I chose to analyze the StackOverflow data from 2015 until 2020 to answer the question in the title and another 2 questions that also bother me, and they are:
* How present are professional developers with no CS background in the market?
* What non-degree education should a data scientist focus on?
* Is job satisfaction related to salary? or are there other factors?


## How present are professional developers with no CS background in the market?

To my surprise I found out that in the 2015 survey, developers with no CS background constitued about 41% of the respondents.

And this percentage remained the same through 2016, before the sudden drop of 2017.

When I examined why the percentage of professional respondents with no CS background decreased I found out the this was due to a continued increase in the number of CS fresh graduates which you can see in the next bar plot.

Before 2017, the number of professional respondents with no CS background exceeded those with CS background, but we can see the shift that happened in 2017.

The number of CS fresh graduates suddenly increased, and kept increasing through out 2018, but by then the composition of the market stabilised with an average 25% of the professional respondents having no CS background.

So even though it may be harder now than before, it still isn't impossible.

And I think that I accept the challenge to be one of these 25%.


## What non-degree education should a data scientist focus on?

When I was first introduced to data science, I was torn between the two ways that people suggested for learning.

Some people suggested starting with books, online courses, part-time programs and mainly starting with the theoritical part.

While another groups insisted that the best way to learn data science is by doing, so pick a project to work on or participate in a compeitition in order to have something to show for the skills that companies need.

So what I did was aggregate the mean salary for the respondents who said they used each on of the education methods listed in the survey, and this is what I found out.

The education method with the highest mean salary was industry certificates. For example, if you have an Azure Data Scientist Associate certification, you are technically certified by Microsoft that you can do Data Science on Azure. 

As certificates go they certainly don't gurantee your skill, but to non-technical people like HR this can easily round up your experience and skills.

Of course this doesn't 100% mean that industry certificate were the **reason** for getting a better paying job, and it might be that some really high paying jobs require their developers to take these certficates.

The second one was on the job training, which goes hand in hand with the hypothesis that high paying jobs give training to their employees, and may require them to take some certificates in some technology like Microsft Azure or AWS.
