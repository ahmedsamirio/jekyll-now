title: My first blog post!
---

I started this blog because I found that I've made some good and bad projects that will go completely unnoticed if I didn't show them. And I don't mean showing them via github, because most of them are already there, and some are still laying sadly unfinished on my local drive. What I mean is showing these projects to other aspiring data scientists (and employers), and establish that I know what I'm talking about. I'm only a data scientist by trade and a pharmacist by profession, and who would hire a pharmacists with no coursework in CS or Maths into a data science position? I don't know but hopefully this blog, along with my github repo, can show future employers that I don't need a CS or Engineering degree to do the job.

My name is Ahmed Samir, and I'm a 25 year old aspiring data scientist that's about to finish his military service as a reserve officer. In the past 2.5 years I've been interested in data science and machine learning, and I tried to make my way through the huge amount of conflicting advice on the internet for getting into this career, and I think that I need a place to speak about my little experience, and share whatever things I'm trying to do or learn. And if it isn't obvious, I'm a terrible writer, so this is a huge challenge for me from that aspect as well.
